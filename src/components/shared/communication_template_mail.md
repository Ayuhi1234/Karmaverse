## Notes for implementation
- Existing in-app notification copy (marked "existing copy — keep") is already live in `UserSocketContext.tsx` / `SocketContext.tsx` — no changes needed there beyond sentence-case cleanup on the Agent side (#3, #4, #5).
- Email sending requires backend integration (e.g. SendGrid/Nodemailer) — not yet implemented; this doc covers content only, ready for backend wiring once available.
- All copy follows sentence case and "Karma Coins" naming per project conventions; emojis used sparingly (🔥 for streaks, 🎉 for rewards, ⭐ for ratings) — drop if CTO prefers zero emojis.
